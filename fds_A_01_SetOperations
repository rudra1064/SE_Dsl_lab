"""In second year computer engineering class, group A
studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students play
badminton and group C students play football.
Write a Python program using functions to compute
following: -
a) List of students who play both cricket and
badminton
b) List of students who play either cricket or
badminton but not both
c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor
badminton
d) Number of students who play cricket and football
but not badminton.
(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries
should be avoided, Do not use SET
built-in functions)"""
